## About Me

I am an Associate Informatics Engineer at Xylem and a current Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, I specialize in building resilient data pipelines and managing real-time data systems. My expertise includes Python, MySQL, and database management, enabling me to efficiently handle complex data workflows and machine learning projects.

At Xylem, I’ve played a key role in maintaining data integrity through precise ETL pipeline management and empowering real-time operations using Docker, AWS ECR/ECS, and CI/CD best practices. I have a growing interest in financial analysis and quantitative finance, particularly in how data-driven insights can drive sustainable, impactful solutions. I’m eager to explore how my technical skills can bridge operations and financial strategy through innovative, data-centered approaches.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the latest advancements in data science, technology, and finance, as well as building personal projects that challenge my skills and expand my knowledge.
